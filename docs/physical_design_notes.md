# Physical Design Notes:
Im going to seperate this into three sections: First, the design philosopy for the clock will be outlined, then the specific design requirements will be expanded upon, before getting to the section about asthetic inspiration.

# Design Philosophy:
I want this clock to be easy and simple to use. The user will mostly use this clock passively, flicking through different modes to quickly glance at information, like the time remaining on a timer or the current weather. Because of this I want **the least amount of inputs possible**, all put together in a way that is intuative for the user. 

I want this to be a desktop or wall mounted item, so the design will need to work if the object is sat on a desk or mounted.

Finally, I want the clock to blend into the scenery when Im not using it. With a large LED screen, this might be a challenge, but we'll see how it works!

# Design Requirements:
The user needs to interact with the clock in different ways. These are listed below:

- change time (increase/decrease)
- change timer length: (increase/increase)
- change alarm time: (increase/decrease)
- adjust brightness: (increase/decrease)

I can see two ways to do this: using button input only, or a button and a scroll wheel.

# Option 1: Buttons:

I'm going to steal the first option from the clock I already have: This only has the following functions:

- Stop the alarm/turn the clock on.
- Toggle the alarm on and off.
- Switch mode.
- Just currently selected variable.

The clock has 5 buttons that achieve all that functionality.

## Option 2: Scrollwheel:
Like an old Blackberry, the clock could also achieve mode switching, adjustment, and brightness changes using a scroll wheel. This scroll wheel would be used to change a variable, while some buttons would be used to select a variable.

Option two could be more aesthetically pleasing, but it is also slightly harder to plan and execute.

# Design Inspiration:
I'm going to keep the design simple and use the same inspiration as everyone else:
- Deiter Rams
- Bauhaus
- Y2K bubbly stuff
- Teenage Engineering.

For materials, 3D printed plastic might be the best option.
