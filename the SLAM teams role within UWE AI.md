# the SLAM teams role within UWE AI:

Our team is a small part of UWE AI. There are multiple teams that all work on different problems. If youre interested in what other teams are doing, just ask your team lead for some introductions.

We can work with all teams within UWE AI at some point. However, there are two teams that we work with more closely than others: **Perception** and **Planning and Control**. Lets summarise what they do below: 

## Perception

Perception is the team that processes raw sensor inputs. Sensors could include a LIDAR, RADAR or a Z-Cam (A camera capable of depth perception.) The role of the perception team is to take this raw input and use it to detect useful landmarks that we can use to control the car.

## Planning and Control

Planning and control 

## How These Teams Relate to SLAM:

Perception produces the inputs to our SLAM algorithm, and planning and control uses our map of the robots environment to make decisions about where the robot should go next.
